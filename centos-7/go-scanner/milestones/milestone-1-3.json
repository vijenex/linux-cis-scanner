      "description": "AIDE takes a snapshot of filesystem state including modification times, permissions, and file hashes which can then be used to compare against the current state of the filesystem to detect modifications to the system. Note: The prelinking feature can interfere with AIDE because it alters binaries to speed up their start up times. Run prelink -ua to restore the binaries to their prelinked state, t hus avoiding false positives from AIDE.",
